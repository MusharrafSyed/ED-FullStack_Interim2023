        Alberta (/ælˈbɜːrtə/ al-BUR-tə) is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. It is part of
        Western Canada and is one of the three prairie provinces. Alberta is bordered by British Columbia to the west,
        Saskatchewan to the east, the Northwest Territories (NWT) to the north, and the U.S. state of Montana to the
        south. It is one
        of the only two landlocked provinces in Canada (Saskatchewan being the other).[8] The eastern part of the
        province
        is occupied by the Great Plains, while the western part borders the Rocky Mountains. The province has a
        predominantly continental climate but experiences quick temperature changes due to air aridity. Seasonal
        temperature swings
        are less pronounced in western Alberta due to occasional Chinook winds.[9]

        <h2>Block-level Elements</h2>

        A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin)
        before and after the element.
        A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it
        can).
        Two commonly used block elements are:

        The element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
        The element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
        Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

        <!-- <address>
        <article>
        <aside>
        <blockquote>
